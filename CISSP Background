The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is a globally recognized certification governed by (ISC)², validating expertise in designing, implementing, and managing a best-in-class cybersecurity program.

As a CISSP candidate/practitioner, I possess a deep understanding of security concepts across the eight domains of the (ISC)² CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK):

Security and Risk Management – Governance, compliance, and risk frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS).

Asset Security – Information classification, ownership, and privacy protection.

Security Architecture and Engineering – Secure design principles for hardware, software, and networks.

Communication and Network Security – Secure network architecture, protocols, and transmission methods.

Identity and Access Management (IAM) – Access control models, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

Security Assessment and Testing – Vulnerability management, security audits, and continuous monitoring.

Security Operations – Incident response, forensics, disaster recovery, and operational resilience.

Software Development Security – Secure coding practices and SDLC integration.

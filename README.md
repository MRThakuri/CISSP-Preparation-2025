The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is a globally recognized certification governed by (ISC)², validating expertise in designing, implementing, and managing a best-in-class cybersecurity program.

As a CISSP candidate/practitioner, we need to possess a deep understanding of security concepts across the eight domains of the (ISC)² CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK):

1.	Security and Risk Management – Governance, compliance, and risk frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS).

2.	Asset Security – Information classification, ownership, and privacy protection.

3.	Security Architecture and Engineering – Secure design principles for hardware, software, and networks.

4.	Communication and Network Security – Secure network architecture, protocols, and transmission methods.

5.	Identity and Access Management (IAM) – Access control models, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

6.	Security Assessment and Testing – Vulnerability management, security audits, and continuous monitoring.

7.	Security Operations – Incident response, forensics, disaster recovery, and operational resilience.

8.	Software Development Security – Secure coding practices and SDLC integration.

🔐 Focus Areas

1.	Enterprise Information Security Governance

2.	Threat Detection and Incident Response

3.	Security Architecture and Risk-Based Controls

4.	Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)

5.	Cloud and Infrastructure Security

🧩 Tools & Frameworks

1.	SIEM: CrowdStrike, Splunk, QRadar

2.	Frameworks: ISO/IEC 27001, NIST 800-53, CIS Controls

3.	Compliance: PCI DSS, GDPR, NRB Cyber Resilience Directives (for banking sector)

4.	Security Testing: VAPT, Threat Modeling, Red Team Exercises
